# PoolPal Ridesharing 

PROBLEMS 

1. Traffic Congestion 

With high expectations of standards of living, many Singaporeans believe in the need of owning a car and can afford one. Hence, traffic is often congested, especially during peak hours.

2. Global Warming

In Singapore, the transportation sector is responsible for about one-third of the country's total carbon emissions.

SOLUTION

Poolpal carpooling web application where drivers can pickup passengers, who are travelling to a similar destination, to share a car ride. The web app connect drivers and passengers and allows the arrangement of shared rides, typically for the purpose of maximising each trip to reduce carbon footprint.

Overall, a carpooling app provides a convenient, cost-effective and sustainable way for people to travel around.
